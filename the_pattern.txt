The rise and fall; the pattern, it is on repeat,

Paranoia kicks in, logic takes the backseat.

The deceitful fear that I need them, to survive,

In their absence, happiness takes a nosedive.

Gonna quit whining "this is how I'm wired",

It can be unlearnt, it was always acquired.

A decade of such self-inflicted pain, no more,

Time to snap out of it, love thyself, and soar.
