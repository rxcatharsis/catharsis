I found myself reaching for the gun,

had to pay for what I had done.

I knew they would call me a coward,

but held it to my head and felt empowered.

All I needed to put myself at ease

was to give the trigger a gentle squeeze.

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes,

heard footsteps and then a faint voice.

He whispered in my ears "It'll get better",

made me throw the gun into the gutter.
